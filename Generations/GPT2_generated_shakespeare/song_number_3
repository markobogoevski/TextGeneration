"And, I do say, you are the son of a Talbot."
"So I shall stay long."
"For, being weak and fearful of his foe,"
"And will, in spite of God, never let go."
"And thus a man becomes a lioness,"

"In proportion as Henry shall be crowned king."
"I am so glad of you, noble Percy!"

"Of France and England, and France and me:"
"Thou art my dearest daughter, thou art Margaret:"
"What more of the devil are you, good William?"
"And yet I am no coward, but an enemy of truth."
"I never did lie to him before."
"In the field, where we shall hide ourselves!"
"That all the army of this day is gone and lost."

"By this I have sworn, to use Henry,"
"A plague upon thee, and thy death upon us all!"
"The Earl of Somerset, whom a traitor set upon"
"We see what fortune is behind him, and, Warwick, my name is Warwick."
"And we will fight for their lives and our liberty."
"I give your Lordship leave to speak, and if we do"
"Be not suspicious of me, though I do meet your grace."
"Ay, my lord, but God's love must I be the"
"And be not offended, for now I can make a cup of me,"
